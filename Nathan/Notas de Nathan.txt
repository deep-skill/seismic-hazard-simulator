We have typically used OpenQuake (Python) tools for the catalogue processing. So, organizing the raw catalogue data into the OpenQuake format will allow you to use the OpenQuake tools later. The image below provides a summary of the necessary format. The attributes with '*' are essential to create the OpenQuake catalogue object. The raw catalogue files (.csv) should be organized to have the same columns as indicated in the image. We also have Python codes that can perform this task.
The GCMT catalogue that I added to SharePoint is one example that is already in OpenQuake forma
If it is helpful, I can share the Python functions we have to organize the catalogues into this format?

I have added two Python scripts to SharePoint in this folder: seismic_catalogue. The main script to run is organize_catalogues_OQ.py, which requires functions from the supporting script cat_preprocessing.py. To run the script, you will need to ensure you have some of the Python packages and dependencies as specified at the beginning of each script. One important thing is that you must also copy the OpenQuake Model Building Toolkit (mbtk) and OpenQuake Engine GitHub repositories, so you can use the Python tools they provide. I included the links in the script.
