Summary of subduction interface source model inputs:

coords:
- Coordinates exported from GIS for the geometry of each interface section
- Coordinates are adopted from Slab2 depth contours split at the interface section boundary

logic_trees:
- Logic tree images for interface sources

Excel files:
Complex_Fault_Source_Template_unweighted_20231204.xlsx:
- Summary of inputs for each interface section, including the contours to be used for each ComplexFaultSource edge, rake, and mag scaling relationship
- Also contains the occurrence rates (UNWEIGHTED) for each of the nine logic tree branches (as per the logic tree image)

Quellaveco_Nazca interface model parameters.xlsx:
- Summary of geometry, coupling, and slip rate input parameters for each interface section, and the corresponding occurrence rates calculated for each section
- These input parameters are also recorded in a table in the draft report
