Summary of subduction in-slab source model inputs:

coords:
- Coordinates exported from GIS for the geometry of each in-slab section

logic_trees:
- Logic tree images for in-slab sources

point_source_grids:
- Excel files containing the latitude and longitude of the 0.1 deg x 0.1 deg grid of in-slab point sources
- Different Excel files correspond to the different b-value branches and in-slab sections (as noted in the filenames)
- Each point source has a corresponding depth (in 'Depth' column) and smoothed occurrence rate (in 'Smoothed Rate Scaled' column)
- b-values for each in-slab section and branch (i.e., U/P/L) are recorded in the Excel files
- FYI: See draft report for details on the approach to calculating and scaling the occurrence rates for each point source
