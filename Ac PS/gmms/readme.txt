1. Abrahamson_gulerce_2020 : two new classes.
		:class:`AG2020SInterBCHydro15`
               	:class:`AG2020SSlabBCHydro15`
	These new classes considers the sigma from BC Hydro (2015) model. Also the sigma can be scaled by defining "factor" in the gmmlt.
	Also an additional "ergodic" flag has been included to obtain the specific sigma. 


2. Kuehn_2020: six new classes.
		:class:`KBCG2020SInterBCHydro15`
                :class:`KBCG2020SSlabBCHydro15`
		:class:`KBCG2020SInterBCHydro15SAN`
		:class:`KBCG2020SInterBCHydro15SAS`
		:class:`KBCG2020SSlabBCHydro15SAN`
		:class:`KBCG2020SSlabBCHydro15SAS`
	These new classes considers the sigma from BC Hydro (2015) model. Also the sigma can be scaled by defining "factor" in the gmmlt.
	Also two new classes will take care of the region specific coefficients for SAM.
	Also an additional "ergodic" flag has been included to obtain the specific sigma.
